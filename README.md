Patch-Wise Attention-Based DenseNet Model for Insect Taxonomy Classification in Rice Plants
Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of a Patch-Wise Attention-Based DenseNet model for insect taxonomy classification in rice plants. The model utilizes a combination of DenseNet architecture and attention mechanisms to effectively classify images of rice plants with various insect infestations.

Model Overview
The Patch-Wise Attention-Based DenseNet model comprises several key components:

DenseNet Architecture: DenseNet is a convolutional neural network architecture that connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. This dense connectivity pattern allows for feature reuse, which leads to more compact models and reduces the risk of overfitting.
Attention Mechanisms: Attention mechanisms enable the model to focus on relevant parts of the image while making predictions. In this model, patch-wise attention mechanisms are employed to attend to specific regions of the input image, enhancing the model's ability to discriminate between different types of insect infestations in rice plants.
Taxonomy Classification: The model is trained to classify images of rice plants into different taxonomic categories based on the presence of insect infestations. By leveraging the features learned through DenseNet and the attention mechanisms, the model achieves high accuracy in classifying rice plant images.
Usage
To use the Patch-Wise Attention-Based DenseNet model for insect taxonomy classification in rice plants, follow these steps:
Preprocess your input images to the required format (e.g., resizing, normalization).
Load the pre-trained model weights (if available) or train the model using your dataset.
Perform inference on your input images using the trained model.
Evaluate the model's performance on your dataset using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
